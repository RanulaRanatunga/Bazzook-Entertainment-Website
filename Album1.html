    <h2 >Baby Driver: Album</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Baby Driver (Music from the Motion Picture) is the soundtrack album of the film. The soundtrack was released on June 23, 2017, on CD, vinyl and digital music via the Columbia Records imprint, 30th Century Records.[29] The album features a combination of artists, from various decades, including Blur, Run the Jewels, Sky Ferreira, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Queen and Golden Earring.[30]

The film takes its name from "Baby Driver", a song from the Simon & Garfunkel album Bridge over Troubled Water. The song is played during the end credits.[31][32] Wright consulted with James Gunn, director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, before Vol. 2 released to ensure the two films did not feature the same songs on their soundtracks </p>
