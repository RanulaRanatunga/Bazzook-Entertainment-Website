    <h2 >Despacito</h2>
    <p class="text_column">""Despacito" (American Spanish: [despa'sito]; English: "Slowly") is a single by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee from Fonsi's upcoming studio album. On January 12, 2017, Universal Music Latin released "Despacito" and its music video, which shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and the local bar La Factoría. The song's music video is the first one to reach over three billion views on YouTube. The song was written by Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo.

It is a reggaeton-pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of ten others, making it both Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's most successful single to date. It became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since "Macarena" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996. The official video for "Despacito" on YouTube received its 1 billionth view on April 20, 2017 after 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone – behind Adele's "Hello"</p>
